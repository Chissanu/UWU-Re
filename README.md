# UWU-Re  
UWU-Re is a cocktail machine which mix 6 different drinks. The drink can be ordered using your mobile phones using webapp. This machine is a our year 2 semester 1 project which is made for 2 subjects, CPS (Cyber - Physical System) and PCA (Principal of Computation and Application).
## List Of Materials
The 3d parts are provided in the provided folder. The 3d printer used is creality ender 3 without any upgrades. You can print the component using the printer itself out of the box. The settings for the 3d printer will also be provided in the folder
### Material used
- Arduino Mega 2560
- NEMA 17HS4401 Stepper Motor x2
- L298N Stepper Motor Driver x2
- T8 screwrod
- Steel rod x2
- 20 x 60 V-slot
- Breadboard
- 12V 5A Switching Power Supply
- Neopixel LED 
- End - Stop switch x4
## The Model
Our machine will be a drink dispenser based on gravity. This means there we won't need any pump to dispense drinks. We will instead use valves to get the amount of liquid needed as seen in the picture

As seen in the picture above, the bottles are installed vertically so that the content inside is at the bottleneck. In addition, the push valve is installed at the tip of the bottle for a precise 5 oz (~ 148 milliliters) and will be pushed by a motor installed on a slider (pink part) in which the slider will also be controlled by a stepper motor at the right side of the machine. Think of this as the machine moving only at the direction x axis and z axis. The blue part is the LCD screen installed for the raspberry pi 4 for Tkinter for user interface. All the electronic component is installed at the side of the machine to prevent damage to the circuitries from leakage. A 3D visualisation can bee seen [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1XuOXg0HMAo?sharecode=GJE946JQ6UPPvVI4ZD06l16DsZAhe3jpPH0mlR12uSo)

## How it works
Our software will have 2 interfaces which is a UI in Tkinter (A python interface) which will be shown on the screen from the machine and a website which the user can order their drinks using their phones. Both of the interface will send input to a python program to fetch the array of recipe from the database stored in a JSON file. After the python program fetch the recipe, the recipe is then sent to Arduino to dispense the drink

## Hardware
We use 12V to power the Arduino Mega 2560 and 2 NEMA stepper motors. The 12V will be provided directly to the 2 L298N stepper motor driver and also hooked up to a buck converter (step down driver) which will convert the voltage to 5v, suitable to power the Arduino Mega. The 4 Endstop switch will also be hooked up to the Arduino Mega and also the Neopixel LEDs. The circuit will look like as follow


### X axis
The x axis consist of a NEMA stpeer motor which will be attach to a timing belt. 

### Z axis
The Z axis consists of a NEMA stepper motor which will turn a screw rod. The screwrod is attatched to a screwhead which will move the head up if the stepper motor spins clockwise and will move down if moves counter clockwise. The reason we use this method instead of using a timing belt is because it is installed vertically and required force to push the dispenser. This means there should not be any lose parts. There will also be 2 End Stop attachments which can be easily adjusted so that we can control how much to go up or down the z-axis.

### Coordination and Calibration
The machine works by going to the x-axis coordination which is pre-recorded, and push the dispenser with the pre recorded z - axis coordination. The machine first needs to recognise the coordinates, therefore calibration is important. When the machine is in calibration mode, the machine will first go to the minimum endstop. When the minimum end stop is pressed, the machine will then move untill the max endstop is reached. Then, them machine will cout how many steps the stepper motor took to reach the end stop (1 step (1.8Â°)) and would return both x and z values. This is the maximum coordinate that both axis have. This flowchart is the summarisation of the calibration process.
